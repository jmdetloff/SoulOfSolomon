Soul Of Solomon is the Ludume Dare 27 submission I build with Tyriq Plummer (http://www.fourbitfriday.com/) The theme of this jam was
10 seconds, so we built a puzzle game where the user must manipulate his environment using astral projection to navigate a maze.
The catch, the user can only project for 10 seconds!

The player can project his spirit to ring bells, douse lamps, and drop coins to lure guards. However, he must return to his body
within 10 seconds or else its game over! And don't let the guards see your physical form!
